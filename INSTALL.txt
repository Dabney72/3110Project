* Make sure you have all the baseline packages from the class OCaml install 
(specifically Unix, Str, OUnit, and Bisect).

* Make sure you also have the Graphics package installed using OPAM 
(the command is "opam install Graphics").

* Additionally to have Graphics be able to open a display window on your
computer you will likely have to do one of the following options:
1) Do a local install of OCaml and download XQuartz and run the project locally
2) Download the OCaml virtual machine and run the project in there

* Once everything is installed you can just run the command "make start" from
the project directory to start the game.
